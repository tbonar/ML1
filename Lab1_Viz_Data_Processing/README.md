# ML1 - Lab 1: Visualization & Data Preprocessing
Central location for storing educational team projects exploring machine learning.

## Introduction
You are to perform analysis of a data set: exploring the statistical summaries of the features,
visualizing the attributes, and making conclusions from the visualizations and analysis. Follow the
CRISP-DM framework in your analysis (you are not performing all of the CRISP-DM outline, only
the portions relevant to understanding and visualization). The format of the document can be PDF, *.ipynb, or HTML. You can write the report in
whatever format you like, but it is easiest to turn in the rendered iPython notebook.
