# ML1 - Mini Lab: Logisitic Regression and SVMs
Central location for storing educational team projects exploring machine learning.

## Introduction
You are to perform predictive analysis (classification) upon a data set: model the dataset using
methods we have discussed in class: logistic regression and support vector machines, and making
conclusions from the analysis. Follow the CRISP-DM framework in your analysis (you are not
performing all of the CRISP-DM outline, only the portions relevant to the grading rubric). 

Write a report covering all the steps of the project. The format of the document can be PDF,
*.ipynb, or HTML.The results should be reproducible using your report. Please carefully
describe every assumption and every step in your report.
