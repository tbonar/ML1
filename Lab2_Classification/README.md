# ML1 - Lab 2: Classification
Central location for storing educational team projects exploring machine learning.

## Introduction
You are to build upon the predictive analysis (classification) that you already completed in the
previous mini-project, adding additional modeling from new classification algorithms as well as
more explanations that are inline with the CRISP-DM framework. You should use appropriate cross
validation for all of your analysis (explain your chosen method of performance validation in detail).
Try to use as much testing data as possible in a realistic manner (you should define what you think
is realistic and why)

The format of the document can be PDF, *.ipynb, or HTML. You can write the report in whatever format 
you like, but it is easiest to turn in the rendered iPython notebook. The results should be 
reproducible using your report. Please carefully describe every assumption and every step in your report.

## Data Selection
Select a dataset identically to the way you selected for the first project work week and mini-project.
You are not required to use the same dataset that you used in the past, but you are encouraged.
You must identify two tasks from the dataset to regress or classify. That is:
* two classification tasks OR
* two regression tasks OR
* one classification task and one regression task
For example, if your dataset was from the diabetes data you might try to predict two tasks: (1)
classifying if a patient will be readmitted within a 30 day period or not, and (2) regressing what the
total number of days a patient will spend in the hospital, given their history and specifics of the
encounter like tests administered and previous admittance.
